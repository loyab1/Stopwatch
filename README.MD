### Project outline

Create a Timer that Tracks your elapsed time on a task.

- A stopwatch Display
- Display up to 3 Tasks and their elapsed durations.
- Allow the user to Start, Stop, and Pause their timers.
- A user must Identify their Task before being able to Start.



### Project Steps

## Application Window
1.	Created two classes: Main and StopWatchDisplay.
2.	Inside StopWatchDisplay, declared a JFrame instance variable.
3.	Inside the display() method, set up the frame’s attributes (size, closing behavior, visibility, etc.).
4.	In the constructor of StopWatchDisplay, you call the display() method so the window is created as soon as the object is constructed.
5.	In the Main class, within main method create a new StopWatchDisplay object 
—the constructor runs, which calls display(), which shows the frame.
